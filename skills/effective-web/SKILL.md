  Design, build, review, and test browser experiences: UI/UX, CSS, React,
  accessibility, responsive layout, typography, forms, motion, i18n, interface
  copy, auth, SEO, performance, SVG, and HTML/CSS print. Use also for
  reference-site specifications, originality reviews, and web legal/consent
  disclosures. A URL alone is not a trigger: general browsing, research
  reports, repository audits, backend work, and non-web publishing are outside
  this skill.

# Effective Web

Choose the route for the browser outcome and load only the references needed
for the affected behavior. Use Design Planning for a new direction and Design
Review and Modernization for a broad redesign; add focused routes as needed.

Work within the product language, supported browsers, and existing contracts.
Preserve accessibility, privacy, authentication, and user data. Add states,
fallbacks, fixtures, and tests for reachable behavior with meaningful user
consequences; avoid speculative combinations.

Verify what the change can affect. Use browser evidence when rendering or
interaction matters, and reuse existing fixtures and checks where sufficient.
Complete authorized implementation and verification before handing back the
result; report material evidence gaps.

## Routing Boundaries

- `effective-product`: research, product direction, scope, interaction models,
  information architecture, decision-grade prototypes, release decisions, and
  durable design decisions recorded as ADRs.
- `effective-marketing`: positioning, commercial page/campaign copy, funnel
  diagnosis, and experiment decisions. Build and verify the chosen variants here;
  interface labels, errors, and states stay here.
- `effective-writing`: editorial articles and public prose, plus locale-level
  punctuation and formatting. Layout and localization UX stay here.
- `effective-engineering`: non-frontend system/data contracts, Rust, shared-library
  TypeScript, focused non-frontend tests, and benchmark methodology.
- `effective-delivery`: repository audits, ports, PR upkeep, dependencies,
  technical documentation, and execution-only requests for established checks.

General browsing or research does not belong here merely because it uses a URL.
Backend infrastructure, deployment, load testing, dedicated security audits,
and non-web publishing need other expertise. Legal and originality work here
supports implementation; it does not establish legal clearance.
