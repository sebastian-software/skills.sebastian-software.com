# Data Tables

Use this skill when the primary UI problem is understanding, comparing, filtering, or acting on structured data.

## Workflow

1. Identify the user's comparison task and the few columns that matter most.
2. Decide whether the data should be a table, list, card set, matrix, or chart.
3. Set column priority, alignment, sorting, filtering, pagination, and row actions.
4. Design empty, loading, partial, overflow, and error states with stable dimensions.
5. Verify keyboard navigation and small-screen behavior.

## Rules

- Align numbers by decimal or right edge; align text by left edge.
- Keep actions close to the row or selection they affect.
- Do not hide essential data behind hover.
- Sticky headers and columns are useful only when they preserve orientation without covering content.
- Responsive tables need an explicit strategy, not horizontal overflow by default.
- Stacked-card patterns that set `display: block` on table elements destroy
  table semantics for screen readers; restore roles
  (`role="table"`/`"row"`/`"cell"`) or prefer keeping table `display` — see
  [html-accessibility.md](html-accessibility.md).
