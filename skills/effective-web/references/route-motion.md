# Motion and Interaction

Use this skill for motion that clarifies state, continuity, feedback, and
progress, or adds an earned moment of brand character without slowing users down.

## Workflow

1. Identify the purpose of motion: feedback, state change, orientation,
   hierarchy, continuity, or earned delight.
2. Remove expressive motion that competes with task completion or appears in a
   dense repeated workflow.
3. Choose CSS, Web Animations, per-frame JavaScript, or a library from the
   required capability and execution model.
4. Prefer compositor-friendly properties and verify costly effects.
5. Keep product transitions short and predictable.
6. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and provide equivalent state clarity without animation.

## Rules

- Author the static, reduced-motion experience first; layer motion inside `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` and never lose information when motion is off.
- Prefer `transform` and `opacity` on hot paths; avoid layout properties and
  measure large filters or other paint-heavy effects.
- Keep UI transitions short (≈150–250ms) and make every animation interruptible by user input.
- Motion should never hide latency or force users to wait for choreography.
- Do not make content available only through hover or scroll tricks.
- Use scroll effects only when they improve comprehension or orientation.
- Feature-detect and reduced-motion-guard View Transitions and scroll-driven animations; the content change must work when they are unsupported.
- Preserve focus, scroll position, URL state, and stable layout during transitions.
- Allow restrained expressive motion in earned brand or success moments; make it
  non-blocking, keyboard-equivalent, and absent from the reduced-motion path.
- Adopt an animation library only when it adds a required capability beyond
  basic platform transitions and keyframes.
