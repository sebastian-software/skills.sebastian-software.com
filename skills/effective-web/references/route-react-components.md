# React Components

Use this route for reusable React component work. Keep React-specific API
decisions connected to semantic HTML, accessibility, forms UX, responsive
layout, and motion rules from the related Effective Web routes.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the existing component conventions: prop naming, state ownership, styling API, accessibility patterns, form library, refs, portals, and test setup.
2. Choose the component boundary: primitive, composed widget, app-specific component, or thin adapter around a headless library.
3. Define state ownership: controlled, uncontrolled, externally managed, form-managed, or derived.
4. Preserve semantic DOM and accessible names. Read the accessibility, forms,
   component, layout, and motion routes when the component renders those concerns.
5. Expose stable extension points: slots/children, `as`/polymorphism only when justified, data attributes, CSS custom properties, refs, and event callbacks.
6. Harden states: loading, empty, error, disabled, success, focus, hover, reduced motion, translated text, SSR/hydration, and async transitions.
