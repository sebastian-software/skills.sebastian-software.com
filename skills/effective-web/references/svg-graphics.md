# SVG Graphics

Build SVG as semantic, scalable interface content rather than opaque path data.
Choose its delivery, coordinate system, accessibility contract, styling surface,
and motion model deliberately.

## Delivery

- Choose CSS geometry for simple, parameterized shapes when the rules remain
  shorter and clearer than an asset. Prefer an exported SVG when CSS recreation
  would require opaque clipping, gradients, pseudo-elements, or hours of tuning.
  Prototype borderline cases and compare maintenance cost, not technical novelty.
- Use `<img src="…svg" alt="…">` for static, cacheable graphics whose internal
  nodes do not need CSS or JavaScript. It behaves like other replaced images and
  keeps the SVG out of the document DOM.
- Use inline `<svg>` when internal shapes need `currentColor`, theme tokens,
  state styling, animation, internal DOM access, or per-instance labels.
- Use an icon component or an intentional `<symbol>`/`<use>` sprite when many
  instances share geometry. Verify styling, accessible naming, external-resource
  policy, and duplicate-ID behavior before standardizing the system.
- Do not inline large static illustrations by default. Repetition bloats HTML,
  delays parsing, and forfeits independent asset caching.

## Coordinate System and Sizing

- Preserve a correct `viewBox="min-x min-y width height"`. It selects and scales
  an internal coordinate region; CSS `width`/`height` or intrinsic dimensions
  control the rendered box.
- Give content images intrinsic `width` and `height` attributes to reserve their
  aspect ratio, then constrain them responsively with `max-inline-size: 100%` and
  `block-size: auto` where appropriate.
- Keep the artwork inside its viewBox with intentional optical padding. Fix
  off-center icon geometry at the source before compensating with arbitrary CSS.
- Collaborate on asset boundaries. Well-prepared SVG parts with intentional
  intrinsic geometry, viewBoxes, and grouping can remove breakpoint logic and
  absolute-positioning compensation from the consuming component.
- Set `preserveAspectRatio` deliberately when the artwork should crop, meet, or
  stretch inside a differently shaped viewport. Do not accept clipping or
  distortion as an accidental default.
- Use `vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"` only when stroke weight should remain
  visually constant while geometry scales; ordinary icons usually benefit from
  strokes scaling with the artwork.

## Shapes and Paths

- Prefer `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, and `<polygon>` when they
  express the geometry. Use `<path>` for curves, arcs, or compound forms that
  simpler shapes cannot represent cleanly.
- Format authored path commands with useful whitespace and line breaks. Optimize
  bytes in the build pipeline; do not sacrifice maintainability for negligible
  pre-compression savings.
- Treat uppercase commands as absolute coordinates and lowercase commands as
  offsets from the previous point. Remember that most drawing commands inherit
  their starting point from the command before them.
- Normalize progress-based stroke effects with `pathLength="100"` when useful,
  then express dash lengths and offsets in that shared scale instead of measuring
  each path in JavaScript.
- Morph only between compatible path topologies, and verify the target browser
  set. If morphing is decorative, allow unsupported browsers to keep the static
  start or end state; add a library only when broad morphing support is required.

## Styling and Accessibility

- Use `fill="currentColor"` or `stroke="currentColor"` for monochrome icons and
  semantic custom properties for multi-color graphics. Keep component state on
  the containing control and let the SVG inherit it.
- Hide decorative inline SVG with `aria-hidden="true"`. For decorative `<img>`,
  use `alt=""`; do not repeat adjacent visible text through the accessibility tree.
- Name an informative inline SVG with `role="img"` and `aria-labelledby` pointing
  to a concise `<title>` and, when needed, `<desc>`. Prefer existing visible text
  as the label when it already describes the graphic. Generate unique title,
  description, gradient, mask, clip-path, and filter IDs per component instance
  so repeated SVGs do not reference one another accidentally.
- Give complex charts and diagrams a nearby textual summary and access to the
  underlying values or relationships. A title alone cannot communicate a dense
  visualization non-visually.
- Put control-like click, keyboard, focus, disabled, and link semantics on a
  surrounding `<button>` or `<a>`. Use direct interaction on SVG nodes only for
  genuinely graphical behavior a native control cannot express, and then supply
  an equivalent keyboard path, focus treatment, semantics, and textual access.
- Verify `currentColor`, focus indication, and meaningful shapes in forced-colors
  mode; do not let fills, masks, or gradients become the only carrier of state.

## Motion and Performance

- Match pointer-triggered SVG motion with `:focus-visible` or activation and
  author it inside the reduced-motion enhancement path. Preserve the final state
  and accessible outcome when motion is absent.
- Prefer transforms and opacity for hot-path motion. Stroke dash animations and
  path morphs can be appropriate for small graphics, but repeated complex paths,
  filters, and large paint regions require profiling.
- Set `transform-box` and `transform-origin` explicitly when SVG transforms pivot
  around the wrong box. For squash/stretch, keep the effect subtle and preserve
  perceived mass by scaling one axis inversely to the other.
- Optimize exported SVG deterministically, but inspect the result. Never allow an
  optimizer to remove a required `viewBox`, accessible title/description, IDs,
  or precision that visibly changes the artwork.

## Review Checklist

- Is the chosen delivery mode justified by caching, styling, interaction, and reuse?
- Does the SVG scale without clipping, distortion, layout shift, or optical drift?
- Is it correctly hidden, concisely named, or accompanied by a fuller text alternative?
- Do theme, hover, focus, disabled, reduced-motion, and forced-colors states work?
- Are paths readable and effects support-gated, maintainable, and measured?
