# Typography Rules

Use this reference for typography decisions: readable measure, wrapping, fluid sizing, local units, editorial rhythm, and text rendering details.

## Working Rules

- Keep body text readable before applying decorative type behavior.
- Use modern wrapping tools on short headings and compact labels only when they improve scannability.
- Use fluid sizing with zoom and user preferences in mind.
- Align icons, decoration, and local spacing to the type context rather than to arbitrary pixels.
- Name shared type tokens by role (`text-body-sm`, `text-label`,
  `text-display`) when a team needs usage rules; use size-only names only when
  their intended roles are already unambiguous. Keep the number of roles,
  families, sizes, and weights deliberately small.
- Prefer the high-level CSS property for registered variable-font axes and
  OpenType features: use `font-weight`, `font-stretch`, `font-style`,
  `font-optical-sizing`, and `font-variant-*`. Reserve
  `font-variation-settings` and `font-feature-settings` for custom axes and
  features that have no dedicated property, so fallbacks retain the intended
  behavior.
- Set `font-synthesis: none` at the root as a deliberate quality default, then
  load every weight and style the interface uses. Treat missing bold or italic
  as an asset/configuration defect to fix rather than silently accepting faux
  glyphs; verify fallback and failure states so hierarchy remains legible while
  fonts load or fail.
- Let link underlines use the font's metrics where available with
  `text-underline-position: from-font` and
  `text-decoration-thickness: from-font`; retain
  `text-decoration-skip-ink: auto`, and tune offset or thickness only when the
  typeface or interaction treatment needs it.
- Use `rem` for global scale decisions and `em`/font-relative units for local component relationships such as icon size, padding, inline gaps, badges, and decorations.
- Prefer `clamp()`-based fluid type within bounded ranges; avoid unbounded viewport-unit type that ignores zoom, user preferences, or narrow/large extremes. Keep at least one term of a fluid `font-size` in a zoom-respecting unit (`rem`/`em`) so text still scales with the browser zoom and default-size settings; never express it in `vw` alone.
- Use `text-wrap: balance` for short headings, card titles, tooltips, modal headings, and FAQs. Do not apply it blindly to long body text or performance-sensitive large blocks; many engines stop balancing after a small number of lines (around 6 in Chromium) and it must not be relied on to change an element's width.
- Use `text-wrap: pretty` for long-form paragraphs to suppress orphans and improve last-line breaks. Treat it as progressive enhancement (support is still uneven across engines and weaker in Firefox), and let it degrade to normal wrapping where unsupported.
- Use `cap` and `rcap` units to size and align type-relative decoration — icons, leading bullets, spacers, and inline buttons — to the cap height of the surrounding text instead of guessing pixels. Provide a pixel or `em` fallback for older engines, since `cap`/`rcap` are recent additions.
- Use `font-size-adjust` to hold perceived text size constant across a webfont swap or a serif/sans mix by pinning the x-height ratio, which removes the size jump and reflow when the fallback is replaced.
- Treat text-box trimming (`text-box-trim` / `text-box-edge`, formerly proposed as `leading-trim`) as the precise way to remove the half-leading above cap height and below the baseline so headings and buttons align to their glyphs rather than their line box. Support is still limited and Chromium-led; gate it behind `@supports` and keep manual optical padding as the fallback.
- For editorial or CMS content, define vertical rhythm from semantic structure rather than arbitrary spacing after every element. Express rhythm with low-specificity selectors — e.g. `:where(h2, h3, p, ul, ol, blockquote, figure)` for the base step and `:has()` for context-sensitive gaps (a heading immediately followed by a paragraph, or a figure between paragraphs) — and reset the first/last child edges so sections do not accumulate stray margins.
- Set measure by content role: paragraphs, lists, captions, and quotations often
  need a narrower readable measure than display headings, tables, code, or media.
  Do not apply one `max-inline-size` indiscriminately to every prose child.
- For user-authored, translated, or CMS text, combine the correct document
  language with `hyphens: auto` where appropriate and an emergency
  `overflow-wrap` strategy for URLs, identifiers, and long unbroken words. Test
  the longest supported locales; hyphenation without the correct `lang` is not a
  reliable overflow solution.
- Stress-test unusually tight display leading with real ascenders, descenders,
  multiple lines, fallback fonts, zoom, and narrow containers. A visually flat
  line-height is acceptable only when glyphs never collide or clip.
- When inline code, highlights, or badges can wrap, use
  `box-decoration-break: clone` where each line fragment needs its own padding,
  background, and border. Keep a readable no-clone fallback and test copied text
  and selection rather than forcing the inline content onto one line.

## Typography Review Checklist

- Are type sizes bounded at minimum and maximum values, and do they still work at browser zoom?
- Is the line length readable for the content type, especially when media or full-bleed layouts are present?
- Do icons, counters, badges, and inline controls align to the font metrics rather than arbitrary pixel centers?
- Are heading wraps intentional, balanced, and still searchable/copyable text?
- Do shared type tokens express their role, and do standard axes/features use
  resilient high-level properties instead of unnecessary raw tags?
- Are all requested weights and styles loaded under the root
  `font-synthesis: none` policy, including fallback and font-failure states?
- Do link underlines follow the font metrics without cutting through glyphs or
  weakening the link affordance?
- Does long-form content keep rhythm across headings, paragraphs, lists, quotes, figures, and first/last child edges?
- Do prose measures reflect content roles, and do long localized words, URLs,
  and identifiers wrap without breaking the layout?
- Does tight display leading survive glyph, fallback-font, zoom, and multiline
  stress cases?
- Are newer text metrics features guarded or treated as progressive enhancement?
