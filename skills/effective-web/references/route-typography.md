# Typography

Use this skill for typography in digital interfaces. It covers type choice, hierarchy, rhythm, readable measure, webfont behavior, and the small text decisions that make UI feel professional.

## Workflow

1. Identify the reading mode: scanning UI, dense data, long-form content, marketing copy, or form completion.
2. Choose a restrained type system: usually one family, two or three weights, and a predictable scale.
3. Set body size, line-height, and line length before tuning headings.
4. Ensure labels, buttons, captions, and helper text remain readable at real device sizes.
5. Check fallback fonts, loading behavior, and layout shift.

## Rules

- Do not scale font size directly with viewport width.
- Keep letter spacing at `0` unless using uppercase, small caps, or a deliberate display treatment.
- Avoid thin low-contrast text in UI.
- Reserve hero-scale type for true heroes; compact panels need compact headings.
- Use typographic hierarchy to reduce explanation, not to add decoration.
