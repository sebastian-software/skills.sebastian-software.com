# S7N German Typography Skill

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

An [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io/) that applies correct German typography rules when writing or reviewing German text.

## The Problem

Without guidance, AI agents typically produce German text with:

- Straight quotes instead of „Anführungszeichen"
- Hyphens where en dashes belong (2020-2025 vs 2020–2025)
- Missing spaces between numbers and units (50kg vs 50 kg)
- Three periods instead of ellipsis character (... vs …)
- ASCII apostrophes instead of typographic ones
- Incorrect spacing around punctuation

## What This Skill Provides

This skill teaches Claude the complete German typography ruleset:

- **Quotation marks**: „German" and «Swiss» styles with proper nesting
- **Dashes**: Hyphen, en dash (ranges and Gedankenstrich), minus sign
- **Spacing**: Non-breaking and thin spaces for units, percentages, abbreviations
- **Special characters**: Ellipsis, multiplication sign, prime marks, capital Eszett
- **Regional variants**: Germany, Austria, and Switzerland conventions
- **Format awareness**: Handles Markdown, HTML, JSX, and plain text appropriately
