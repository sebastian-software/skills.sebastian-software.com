# Rendering Performance

Optimize React rendering by finding the actual source of work before adding memoization.

## Working Rules

- Identify what changed, which component re-rendered, and whether the render was expensive.
- Use memoization only when it removes real repeated work or stabilizes meaningful props.
- Use deferred rendering and transitions when user input needs to stay responsive.
- Avoid architecture that spreads high-churn state through broad context or global rerender paths.
