# Browser Performance

Use measured browser behavior to guide performance changes. Prioritize fixes that improve user-visible loading, rendering stability, and interaction latency without making the system harder to maintain.

## Working Rules

- Keep LCP resources discoverable in initial HTML whenever possible.
- Do not lazy-load above-the-fold or likely-LCP images.
- Use responsive images to match rendered size and DPR without exploding variant count.
- Reserve media and widget space to avoid avoidable CLS.
- Use cache freshness directives deliberately; stale content can improve perceived speed only when the product can tolerate the freshness model.
- Treat placeholder techniques as perceived-performance tools, not substitutes for correct image delivery.
