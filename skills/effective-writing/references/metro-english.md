# Metro English

Rewrite text so it sounds like a smart teammate wrote it quickly but carefully:
clear, direct, warm enough, and a little loose. The target voice is polished
casual with a bit of startup Slack energy, not corporate copy and not internet
slang.

Remove obvious AI writing patterns, then add human rhythm and judgment. The
point is not to make the text fancy. The point is to make it sound like a real
person communicating with a real team.

## Hard Boundary

Before rewriting, stop when a named controlled-language contract governs the
artifact: ASD-STE100, another Simplified Technical English requirement, or an
adopted project profile for controlled technical English. Hand that artifact to
the technical-documentation route in `effective-delivery`. Do not rewrite,
quote, correct, or suggest language for it, even when the user also asks for a
casual version.

Metro English still owns the team conversation about that work. Return the
handoff for the controlled artifact together with the Slack, PR, issue, or chat
message the user asked for about it.

A plain-language policy, a house readability rule, or a formal register is not a
controlled-language contract. Treat it as a constraint on vocabulary and
formality and keep the rewrite here.

## Decision Context

Read accepted ADRs and house-style guidance when the text belongs to a project
with a recorded audience relationship, voice, formality, terminology, or
channel rule. Apply the Metro English treatment inside those constraints rather
than replacing the organization's voice with a generic startup persona.

An explicit user request may intentionally override the recorded style for one
artifact; surface the divergence when it could create cross-channel drift. Use
the decision-record route in `effective-product` when the work establishes or
changes a durable communication direction instead of creating a
Metro-English-specific memory file.

## What this route does

Use this for:

- Slack or chat messages
- GitHub, GitLab, Linear, Jira, and issue comments
- PR review comments and handoff notes
- Async project updates
- Short internal announcements
- Quick feedback, nudges, and status replies
- German-to-English rewrites for team communication
- Stiff English that needs to sound more natural

When the user gives German source text, translate the meaning into natural team
English instead of translating word by word.

For PR reviews, Metro English owns phrasing only. Preserve supplied facts,
severity, required-versus-optional meaning, reviewer audience, and decision.
The PR-review route in `effective-delivery` owns finding validity, consequence,
placement, blocking language, bot-versus-human reply behavior, publication, and
the approve/request-changes decision. Do not infer or change those semantics
while making the prose sound natural.

## Voice target

Aim for:

- Everyday US professional English, closer to NYC/SF/Silicon Valley team chat
  than to corporate comms.
- Shorter sentences with natural variation.
- Contractions where they sound normal: "I'm", "we're", "that's", "doesn't".
- Plain verbs: "fix", "ship", "check", "move", "cut", "keep", "drop",
  "split", "follow up".
- Light personality: "I think", "feels like", "this part is a bit off",
  "nice catch", "I'd keep this simpler".
- Direct asks and clear next steps.
- Respectful confidence. Be candid without sounding harsh.

The text should feel written in the flow of work. It can be a little imperfect,
but it should not be careless.

## Rewrite rules

1. Preserve the user's intent, facts, names, constraints, and decision.
2. Make the message shorter unless the user asked for detail.
3. Replace formal scaffolding with natural phrasing.
4. Remove generic praise and chatbot politeness.
5. Use first person when it helps: "I'd", "I think", "I don't think we need".
6. Keep technical language when it carries meaning, but drop padded wording
   around it.
7. Make the ask obvious: what should happen, who is blocked, or what decision is
   needed.
8. Keep a human rhythm. Mix one-line sentences with slightly longer ones.
9. If the source is tense or critical, make it calmer without hiding the point.
10. If the source is too blunt, add a little warmth without adding fluff.

## Avoid

Do not add fake local flavor. No forced NYC, SF, or Silicon Valley stereotypes.
No "bro", "hustle", "move fast", "10x", "vibes", or VC-speak unless the user
clearly wants that.

Avoid AI and corporate patterns:

- "delve", "crucial", "pivotal", "robust", "seamless", "leverage"
- "underscores", "showcases", "serves as a testament"
- "I hope this helps", "certainly", "great question", "you're absolutely right"
- "not only... but also..."
- forced rule-of-three lists
- title-case mini headers in short comments
- bolded label bullets like "**Issue:**"
- em dash-heavy prose
- generic upbeat endings like "exciting times ahead"

Avoid sounding:

- overly polished
- performatively casual
- passive-aggressive
- sycophantic
- like a press release
- like a chatbot explaining its own work

## Context presets

### Slack or team chat

Keep it compact. One short paragraph is usually enough. If there are actions,
use 2-4 bullets. Use "quick" only when it actually fits.

Good patterns:

- "Quick heads-up: ..."
- "I think we can keep this simple: ..."
- "I'm blocked on ..."
- "Can someone sanity-check ..."
- "I'll take the first pass and post an update here."

### Issue comments

Be specific about the current state, the problem, and the next step. Avoid long
setup. If the issue is not ready, say what is missing.

Good patterns:

- "I can reproduce this with ..."
- "This looks like ..."
- "I think the fix should live in ..."
- "Let's split this from ..."
- "I don't think this is part of this ticket."

### PR review comments

Apply the PR ownership boundary above. Rewrite the supplied intent so it sounds
like a teammate, not a compliance bot, without changing its consequence or
required-versus-optional meaning.

Good patterns:

- Supplied blocker: "One thing we need to fix before merging: ..."
- Supplied optional note: "Small suggestion, totally optional: ..."
- Supplied approval: "Nice cleanup. Approving."
- Supplied uncertainty: "The part I'm less sure about is ..."

### Async updates

Lead with the actual status. Then add the blocker, decision, or next step. Do not
bury the point under context.

Good patterns:

- "Status: ..."
- "What's done: ..."
- "What's left: ..."
- "The decision we need is ..."
- "I'll follow up once ..."

### Docs-adjacent notes

Stay natural, but be a little more durable than Slack. Keep contractions if they
sound right. Avoid jokes or throwaway phrasing that will age badly.
Use the technical-documentation route in `effective-delivery` instead when the
artifact itself is a manual, API or CLI reference, controlled-language document,
or normative technical procedure. Do not rewrite that controlled artifact here.
Return a concise handoff or, when the documentation route is also active, apply
it as the separate owner. An internal note, changelog entry, or PR description
about that document stays here.

Good patterns:

- "This doc is the source of truth for ..."
- "Keep this section focused on ..."
- "If this changes, update ..."
- "This is intentionally out of scope for now."

## Examples

### Formal PR review comment

Input:
> The implementation appears to be largely correct. However, it is important to
> note that the error handling path could potentially lead to confusing behavior
> for users in the event that the request fails.

Output:
> This mostly looks right. The error path can leave users in a pretty confusing
> state when the request fails.

### Stiff Slack update

Input:
> I would like to provide a brief update regarding the current status of the
> migration effort. We have completed the initial investigation and are now
> proceeding with implementation.

Output:
> Quick update on the migration: the initial investigation is done, and we're
> moving into implementation now.

### AI-ish issue comment

Input:
> This issue highlights a crucial gap in the current validation landscape and
> underscores the need for a more robust approach to handling malformed input.

Output:
> This looks like a validation gap. We should handle malformed input earlier, so
> the downstream code never sees this shape.

### German team note

Input:
> Ich glaube, wir sollten das nicht in diesem PR machen. Das ist eigentlich ein
> separates Thema und macht den Review nur unnoetig gross.

Output:
> I don't think we should do this in this PR. It's a separate thread, and adding
> it here will just make the review harder than it needs to be.

### Too blunt

Input:
> This is wrong. Please redo it.

Output:
> I don't think this is the right path yet. Can you take another pass and align it
> with the approach in the existing flow?

## Output format

By default, return only the rewritten text.

When the user asks only whether a short internal message sounds generated,
return the concrete patterns and representative phrases that create that
effect, plus a brief correction direction. Do not infer authorship, assign an
AI probability, or rewrite the message unless asked.

For a controlled technical-language request, return a short handoff that names
the governing requirement and directs the artifact to the
technical-documentation route in `effective-delivery`. Do not include a
rewritten excerpt, a compliant alternative, or wording suggestions for the
controlled artifact. Add the requested internal message about that work when the
user asked for one.

Only include notes, alternatives, or an explanation when the user asks for them.
If the user asks for options, provide two:

1. A polished casual version.
2. A slightly looser Slack-style version.

If the original has important ambiguity, preserve it or ask a short question
before rewriting. Do not invent facts, decisions, approvals, deadlines, or blame.

## Boundaries

- Improve language, not substance. Route technical, legal, product, and
  documentation correctness to the owner of the underlying work.
- Keep general, public, and long-form prose audits on the voice-audit route.
  Short internal Slack, issue, PR, and async-message audits and rewrites stay
  here.
- Route locale-specific typography and punctuation to the locale typography
  route.
