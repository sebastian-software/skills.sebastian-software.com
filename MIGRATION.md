# Migration: 33 Skills → 6 Effective Disciplines

This collection consolidated its 33 first-party skills into six top-level
discipline skills that share one naming grammar and one internal architecture.
No guidance was deleted. Every absorbed `SKILL.md` body became a route reference
inside its discipline, and every `references/` file moved with it.

The rationale and execution plan are in
[RFC 0001](docs/rfc/0001-effective-disciplines.md); the accepted decision is
recorded in [ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-effective-disciplines.md).

## The six disciplines

| Discipline | One-line story |
| --- | --- |
| [`effective-product`](skills/effective-product/README.md) | Decide what to build and how it should work |
| [`effective-web`](skills/effective-web/README.md) | Build the browser experience as one system |
| [`effective-engineering`](skills/effective-engineering/README.md) | Design and write the software itself |
| [`effective-delivery`](skills/effective-delivery/README.md) | Move repositories and teams forward safely |
| [`effective-writing`](skills/effective-writing/README.md) | Prose that people trust and act on |
| [`effective-marketing`](skills/effective-marketing/README.md) | Take verified value to market |

## Old slug → new home

| Old skill | Discipline | Route |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `codebase-improvement` | `effective-delivery` | Codebase Audit and Plans |
| `consultant-profile` | `effective-marketing` | Consultant Profile (plus Profile Voice and Profile Evidence) |
| `conversion-optimization` | `effective-marketing` | Conversion Optimization |
| `create-social-content` | `effective-marketing` | Social Content |

| `product-management` | `effective-product` | Discovery and Evidence Review, Strategy and Operating Model, Scope, Quality, and Shipping |
| `product-marketing` | `effective-marketing` | Positioning, Messaging, Launch, Market Learning |
| `product-naming` | `effective-product` | Product and Feature Naming |
| `reference-analysis` | `effective-web` | Reference Analysis |
| `rust-engineering` | `effective-engineering` | Rust Engineering, Rust Architecture, Rust Performance, Rust Unsafe and SIMD |
| `smart-dependency-updater` | `effective-delivery` | Dependency Updates |
| `software-architecture` | `effective-engineering` | Software Architecture |
| `software-testing` | `effective-engineering` | Focused Testing, Benchmark Methodology |
| `software-validation` | `effective-delivery` | Repository Validation |
| `tech-docs` | `effective-delivery` | Technical Documentation |
| `typescript-engineering` | `effective-engineering` | TypeScript Engineering |
| `web-legal-compliance` | `effective-web` | Web Legal Compliance |

`effective-web` kept its name, its 25 existing intent routes, and all of its
references; it absorbed the three skills listed above.

## What changed for you

**If you installed a skill by name**, replace the old selection with its
discipline:

```sh
npx skills add sebastian-software/skills.sebastian-software.com --skill effective-delivery
```

```sh
dalo source select sebastian effective-delivery
dalo approve skill sebastian:effective-delivery
dalo sync
```

**If you did not pin anything**, nothing breaks. Old slugs remain installable
for one release window as deprecation stubs: each keeps its original frontmatter
so existing triggers still resolve, and its body redirects to the discipline
that absorbed it. The stubs contain no guidance.

**Stub sunset:** 2026-10-31, or one release cycle after the consolidation
release, whichever is later. The registry lives in
[`docs/deprecated-skills.json`](docs/deprecated-skills.json).

## Renamed reference files

Files kept their names except where pooling made them ambiguous:

- `rust-engineering/references/*.md` → `rust-*.md`
- `typescript-engineering/references/*.md` → `typescript-*.md`
- `linkedin-posts` and `linkedin-social-selling` references → `linkedin-*.md`
- `locale-typography/references/*.md` → `locale-*.md`
- `web-legal-compliance/references/*.md` → `legal-*.md`
- `pr-review/references/voice.md` → `review-voice.md`
- `pr-review/references/voice-examples.md` → `review-voice-examples.md`
- `smart-dependency-updater/references/workflow.md` → `dependency-workflow.md`

The three byte-identical copies of `worktree-safety.md` in `port-codebases`,
`pr-review`, and `smart-dependency-updater` merged into one shared file in
`effective-delivery`.

## Routes that were split

Four absorbed skills exposed more than the 900-line route context budget once
their references pooled, so their route was split rather than registered as an
exception:

- `consultant-profile` → Consultant Profile, Profile Voice and Localization,
  Profile Evidence and Interviews
- `rust-engineering` → Rust Engineering, Rust Architecture, Rust Performance and
  Memory, Rust Unsafe and SIMD
- `pr-review` → PR Review and Upkeep, Review Provider Access
- `software-testing` → Focused Testing, Benchmark Methodology (per
  [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-performance-testing-ownership.md))
